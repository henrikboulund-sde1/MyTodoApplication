# MyTodoApplication
This is a solution to an exercise, on the 1st semester of the Computer Science education.

In this exercise the student should develop a small application to handle todos. The state of the application is not saved, and everything is therefore lost when closing the application.

Todos can be moved from "Todos" to "In progress" and to "Done" and back again.

The button "Add new todo", makes a new todo in the ToDos listview and you can edit the todo by dobble clicking it.
